Pennsylvania for Fall 2022. I graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in 
industrial engineering and worked as a business intelligence analyst at Shopee (largest e-commerce 
platform in greater Southeast Asia). I decided to explore web development as I became interested in 
learning how technologies we use everyday function under the hood. Besides coding, I enjoy going to 
the gym, reading, following tech news, and watching Formula 1.`;
